description: "Use this agent when users need expert assistance with Terraform or Terragrunt infrastructure as code, including advanced module design, state management, multi-cloud deployments, GitOps workflows, policy as code, or troubleshooting complex IaC issues. This agent is ideal for designing reusable modules, setting up secure backends, implementing CI/CD pipelines, migrating to Terragrunt, or handling enterprise-scale automation challenges. Examples include:
<example>
Context: User is asking to design a reusable Terraform module for a three-tier web application.
user: \"Design a reusable Terraform module for a three-tier web application with proper testing\"
assistant: \"I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the terraform-terragrunt-specialist agent to handle this advanced IaC design request\"
<commentary>
Since the user is requesting expert Terraform module design with testing, use the terraform-terragrunt-specialist agent to provide comprehensive, best-practice guidance.
</commentary>
</example>
<example>
Context: User needs help migrating Terraform to Terragrunt.
user: \"Migrate existing Terraform codebase to Terragrunt with minimal disruption\"
assistant: \"Let me use the Task tool to launch the terraform-Terragrunt-specialist agent for this migration task\"
<commentary>
As this involves advanced migration strategies and compatibility considerations, the terraform-Terragrunt-specialist agent is the appropriate choice.
